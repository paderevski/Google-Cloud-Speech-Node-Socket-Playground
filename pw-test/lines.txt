In a sense we have come to our nation’s capital to cash a check.
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words 
of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, 
they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.
This note was a promise that all men, yes, 
black men as well as white men, 
would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
It is obvious today
that America has defaulted on this promissory note
insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.
Instead of honoring this sacred obligation,
America has given the Negro people a bad check,
a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.
We refuse to believe 
that there are insufficient funds
in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.
So we have come to cash this check — 
a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom
and the security of justice.
We have also come to this hallowed spot 
to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off 
or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
Now is the time to rise 
from the dark and desolate valley of segregation 
to the sunlit path of racial justice.
Now is the time 
to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice 
to the solid rock of brotherhood.
Now is the time to make justice 
a reality for all of God’s children.
